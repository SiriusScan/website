# Authentication

> **⚠️ Coming Soon:** API key authentication is currently under development and will be available before the v1.0 release. The current API implementation is unauthenticated.

Sirius Scan will use API keys to authenticate requests. This documentation outlines the planned authentication system that will be implemented before the v1.0 release.

## Planned Authentication System

The upcoming authentication system will provide:

- API key management through the Sirius Scan dashboard
- Secure request authentication using Bearer tokens
- Fine-grained permission controls
- Environment-specific API keys
- Automated key rotation capabilities

We recommend following this documentation's structure to prepare for the authentication system's release. Subscribe to our release notifications to be informed when API key authentication becomes available.

## Current Status

The API is currently unauthenticated during the development phase. This means:

- No authentication is required to make API requests
- All endpoints are publicly accessible
- This is temporary and will change before the v1.0 release
- Not recommended for production use until authentication is implemented

## Obtaining an API Key

1. Log in to your Sirius Scan dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
3. Click **Create New API Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name and select the appropriate permissions
5. Copy and securely store your API key - it will only be shown once

## Using API Keys

### REST API

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.siriusscan.com/v1/hosts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Go SDK

Initialize the SDK client with your API key:

```go
import "github.com/siriusscan/sirius/sdk"

client := sirius.NewClient("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Environment Variables

We recommend storing your API key in an environment variable:

```bash
# Set the API key
export SIRIUS_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Use in curl commands
curl -X GET "https://api.siriusscan.com/v1/hosts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SIRIUS_API_KEY"
```

In Go applications:

```go
import (
    "os"
    "github.com/siriusscan/sirius/sdk"
)

client := sirius.NewClient(os.Getenv("SIRIUS_API_KEY"))
```

## Best Practices

1. **Never hardcode API keys** in your application code or version control
2. Use environment variables or secure secret management systems
3. Rotate API keys periodically
4. Use separate API keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
5. Grant minimal required permissions to each API key

## Response Codes

| Status Code | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 200         | Success - Request authenticated successfully   |
| 401         | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key      |
| 403         | Forbidden - API key lacks required permissions |

## Example Error Responses

### Invalid API Key

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_api_key",
    "message": "The provided API key is invalid or has been revoked",
    "status": 401
  }
}
```

### Missing API Key

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "missing_api_key",
    "message": "No API key provided. Include your API key in the Authorization header",
    "status": 401
  }
}
```

### Insufficient Permissions

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "insufficient_permissions",
    "message": "The provided API key does not have permission to perform this action",
    "status": 403
  }
}
```
